/**
 * Catalog of the Gemini models SwiftSlate curates and how each is tuned. Mirrors
 * [GroqModels]: each curated model is defined once in [SPECS] together with its
 * thinking level, and the default, display labels, and per-model thinking level
 * all derive from that single table. Since issue #148 the Settings dropdown no
 * longer renders from this table — it lists whatever the provider's /models
 * endpoint returns (see [ProviderModelsCache]); SPECS remains the source for
 * defaults, friendly names, and thinking levels.
 *
 * Thinking control on Gemini 3.x is via generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel
 * (a string enum), kept per model here (spec-driven) rather than hardcoded in the
 * client — exactly like Groq's per-model reasoning params:
 *  - "minimal" keeps latency low for short, inline text transformations. Without
 *    it, gemini-3.6-flash defaults to "medium" thinking (~4-5s per request).
