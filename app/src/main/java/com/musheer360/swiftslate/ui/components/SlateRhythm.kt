/**
 * The one vertical rhythm every tab is laid out on.
 *
 * Dashboard and Commands each fit a single viewport with no root scroll and their last
 * card anchored flush [screenPaddingV] above the nav bar. Settings is the exception: it
 * scrolls, because it also hosts provider, key, model and temperature settings.
 *
 * The height budget still varies by roughly 120 dp between phones: a Galaxy S23 gives the
 * content area ~697 dp, a Nothing Phone 2a ~821 dp. One rigid set of tokens cannot
 * serve both — at 14 dp padding the S23 was ~43 dp short and clipped the bottom
 * card, while the 2a had ~81 dp spare that piled up into a single void.
 *
 * So the tokens interpolate against the available height: short viewports compact
 * every gap until everything fits, tall viewports let all cards breathe by the
 * same amount. Because a single instance is provided for the whole app through
 * [LocalSlateRhythm], every tab necessarily agrees on padding, gaps and type — the
 * tabs cannot drift apart the way they do with per-screen hardcoded dp values.
 *
 * Deliberately fixed, because they are structural rather than cosmetic:
 * [screenPaddingH]/[screenPaddingV] (they set the shared page frame and the
 * bottom-card anchor), [cardGap] and [listGap] (8 dp, the app's baseline step),
 * and the body type sizes (13/15 sp is already the readable floor — compacting
 * type to win layout height trades legibility for space).
 *
 * Note that Android's official window *height* size classes are too coarse to use
 * here: compact is < 480 dp and medium is 480-900 dp, so both phones land in the
 * same bucket despite the 120 dp gap between them. Hence the continuous ramp.
